## Web design and development

A lot of business owners get burned on websites by people who over-promise and under-deliver. Then they get stuck with a slow site that doesn’t work how they expect, and needs to be fixed by someone else at an increased cost.

My name is Paul Garcia, I build clean, fast WordPress websites that relieve all that hassle. You’ll get a website that looks modern, loads fast, works perfectly on all devices, and is easy to use and maintain — even if you decide to hire someone else to work on it later.

### What makes me different

From building high-performing marketing and sales systems for major telecom and media companies _(you might have even used software I built if you’ve ever signed up for a cable TV or Internet package online)_ to building web software in finance, not only do I have the skills to deliver the work, I’m looking to develop lasting partnerships.

My process is **designed with you in mind**.

_You’ll get_

- Great communication
- Fast response times
- Professional-quality work
- Total transparency

### How it works

- **Discovery** – We’ll determine if we’re a good fit to work together, discuss project requirements and how your site will be built.
- **Requirements** – You provide me with content, and all of the specifications for your website.
- **Development** – I start building your new site. You’ll get a link to my project management system where you can check-in on the status of your project milestones
- **QA/Testing** – Your site will be fully tested, including support for all major browsers and device sizes. You’ll get to review a live version of the new site that’s only accessible to you, so if there are any issues no one else will see them.
- **Launch** – After making a complete backup of your existing site, it will be replaced with the new site and go live!

## Website care and maintenance

I offer monthly website care and maintenance plans to help keep your website safe, secure and working and looking it’s best. My plans can include (but are not limited to):

- WordPress version updates
- Theme updates
- Plugin updates
- Backup and restore
- Scan for broken links
- Content updates
