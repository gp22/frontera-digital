Originally from the central coast of California… I taught myself web and app development several years ago while traveling and working as a digital nomad.

Since then, I’ve developed websites and apps for Fortune 500 companies in telecom, media, and finance — and have helped build and run marketing campaigns for a major digital marketing agency.

I’m still a digital nomad. My business is fully remote, and I collaborate with incredible people from all over the country.

I'm not big on labels but I consider myself an athlete, entrepreneur, minimalist, and a free-thinker. Want to know more about me personally? Check out [my personal site](https://paulgarcia.me).

My goal—as a problem solving partner—is to help you accomplish your business goals and ease at least a little bit of your workload so you can focus on what you do best.

I hope we can make something great together!
