          Hi, Iâ€™m Paul. You probably don't really want a websiteâ€”it's just a
          means to an endâ€”you want the results it provides. Whether that's more
          email subscribers, more leads, more sales, or something else, I can
          help you achieve your goals with clean, modern websites designed to
          get you results.
